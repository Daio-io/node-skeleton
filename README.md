Node, Express, Handlebars and Mongoose Skeleton

This skeleton provides a simple set up for a Node.js with Express framework using Handlebars. Used mainly for rapid prototyping but can just as easily be built into a fully fledged WebApp.

Implementation for MongoDB is available through Mongoose. You just need to set up a MongoDB or use MongoLab
and add the connection strings to the ./lib/credentials.js file.

To run the app make sure you have node installed. Navigate to the root of the directory and type into your terminal

    npm install
    
to install all dependancies in package.json then: 

    node index.js or node index_cluster.js
    
To run the app

Please feel free to provide any feedback

Thanks.
