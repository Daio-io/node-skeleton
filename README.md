node-skeleton
=============

Node, Express, Handlebars, Mongoose and Bootstrap (CDN) Skeleton

This skeleton provides a simple set up for a Node.js with Express framework using Handlebars. Used mainly for rapid prototyping but can just as easily be built into a fully fledged WebApp.

To run the app make sure you have node installed and MongoDB running (or comment/remove MongoDB connection code).

Install all dependencies in package.json:

    npm install
    
then:

    node index.js

or:

    node index_cluster.js
    
To run the app
