=============

Node, Express, Handlebars and Mongoose Skeleton

This skeleton provides a simple set up for a Node.js with Express framework using Handlebars. Used mainly for rapid prototyping but can just as easily be built into a fully fledged WebApp.

Implementation for MongoDB is available through Mongoose.

To run the app make sure you have node installed. Navigate to the root of the directory and type into your terminal

    npm install
    
to install all dependencies in package.json then:

    node index.js or node index_cluster.js
    
To run the app
